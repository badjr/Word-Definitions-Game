cycle: process execution consists of a ____ of CPU execution and I/O wait. 262
CPU burst: process execution begins with a ____ ____, which is followed by an I/O burst, which is followed by another ____ ____, and so on. 262
I/O burst: process execution begins with a CPU burst, which is followed by an ____ ____, which is followed by another CPU burst, and so on. 262
short term scheduler: whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the processes in the ready queue to be executed. The selection process is carried out by the ____ ____ ____. 263
running to waiting: CPU-scheduling decisions may take place under four conditions. The first is when a process switches from the ____ state to the ____ state. 263
running to ready: CPU-scheduling decisions may take place under four conditions. The second is when a process switches from the ____ state to the ____ state. 263
waiting to ready: CPU-scheduling decisions may take place under four conditions. The third is when a process switches from the ____ state to the ____ state. 263
terminates: CPU-scheduling decisions may take place under four conditions. The fourth is when a process ____. 263
nonpreemptive: when scheduling takes place only under the 1st and 4th conditions of process states, this scheduling scheme is used. 264
nonpreemptive: in this kind of scheduling, once the CPU has been allocated to a process, the process keeps the CPU until it released the CPU either by terminating or by switching to the waiting state. 264
race conditions: preemptive scheduling can result in ____ ____ when data are shared among several processes. 264
dispatcher: the ____ is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler. 265
dispatcher latency: the time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another. It must be as fast as possible, since it's invoked during every process switch. 265
CPU utilization: one of the critera suggested for comparing CPU-scheduling algorithms. we want to keep the CPU as busy as possible. In a real system, it should range from 40% (lightly loaded system) to 90% (heavily loaded system). 265
throughput: one of the critera suggested for comparing CPU-scheduling algorithms. a measure of the number of processes that are completed per time unit. 265
turnaround time: one of the critera suggested for comparing CPU-scheduling algorithms. the interval from the time of submission of a process to the time of the completion. it's the sum of the periods spent waiting to get into memory, waiting in the ready queue, executing on the CPU, and doing I/O. In other words, completion - arrival. 265
waiting time: one of the critera suggested for comparing CPU-scheduling algorithms. the sum of the periods spent waiting in the ready queue. 265
response time: one of the critera suggested for comparing CPU-scheduling algorithms. the time from the submission of a request until the first response is produced. 265
maximize: it is desirable to ____ CPU utilization and throughput and to minimize turnaround time, waiting time, and response time. 266
mininize: it is desirable to maximize CPU utilization and throughput and to ____ turnaround time, waiting time, and response time. 266
first come first served: with this scheduling scheme, the process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU first. 266
first come first served: the average waiting time under this scheduling scheme is often quite long. 266
convoy effect: when other processes wait for one big process to get off the CPU, resulting in lower CPU and device utilization than might be possible if the shorter processes were allowed to go first. 267
shortest job first: with this scheduling scheme, the CPU is assigned to the process that has the smallest next CPU burst. 268
shortest job first: the average waiting time under this scheduling scheme is provably optimal, in that it gives the minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes. 268
