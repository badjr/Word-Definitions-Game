Object Modeling Technique: OML stands for ___ ___ ___. 15
OMT: ___ provides methods for three activities; analysis, focusing on formalizing the system requirements into an object model, system design, focusing on strategic decisions, and object design, which transforms the analysis model into an object model that can be implemented. 15
Requirements Elicitation: ____ ____, one of the SE development activities associated with OO SE, is when the client/developers define the purpose of the system. 16
actor: an ____ represents the external entitiy that interacts with the system. 16
actor: ____s include roles such as end users, other computers the system needs to deal with (eg a central bank computer, a network), and the environment (eg a chemical process). 16
use case: a ___ ___ is a general sequence of events that describe all possible actions between an actor and the system for a given piece of functionality. 16
analysis: ____, one of the SE development activities associated with OO SE, is when developers aim to produce a model of the system that is correct, complete, consisten, and unambiguous. 16
analysis: during ____, developers transform the use cases produced during requirements elicitation into an object model that completely describes the system. 16
system design: ____ ____, one of the SE development activities associated with OO SE, is when developers define the design goals of the project and decompose the system into smaller subsystems that can be realized by individual teams. 19
system design: in ____ ____, developers also select strategies for building the system, such as the hardware/software platform on which the system will run, the persistent data management strategy, the global control flow, the access control polocy, and the handling of boundary conditions. 19
object design: ____ ____, one of the SE development activities associated with OO SE, is when developers define solution domain objects to bridge the gap between the analysis model and the hardware/software platform defined during system design. 19
