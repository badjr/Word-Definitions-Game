control word: The control unit initiates a series of sequential steps of microoperations. During any given time, certain microoperations are to be initiated, while others remain idle. The control variables at any given time can be represented by a string of 1's and 0's, called a ____ ____. 223
microinstruction: each word in control memory contains within it a ____. It specifies one or more microoperations for the system. 224
microprogram: A sequence of microinstructions consitutes a ____. 224
dynamic: a more advanced development known as ____ microprogramming permits a microprogram to be loaded initially from an auxiliary memory such as a magnetic disk. 224
control memory: Control units that use dynamic microprogramming employ a writable control memory. This type of memory can be used for writing (to change the microprogram) but is used mostly for reading. A memory that is part of a control unit is referred to as a ____ ____. 224
control address register: the ____ ____ ____ specifies the address of the microinstruction, and the control data register holds the microinstruction read from memory. 225
sequencer: the next address generator is sometimes called a microprogram ____, as it determines the address sequence that is read from control memory. 225
pipeline register: the control data register holds the present microinstruction while the next address is computed and read from memory. The data register is sometimes called a ____ ____. It allows the execution of the microoperations specified by the control word simultaneously with the generation of the next microinstruction. 225
hardwired control: most computers based on the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture concept use hardwired control rather than a control memory with a microprogram. 226
routine: microinstructions are stored in control memory in groups, with each group specifying a ____. 226
mapping: the transformation from the instruction code bits to an address in control memory where the routine is located is referred to as a ____ process. 226
PLD: the mapping function is sometimes implemented by means of an integrated circuit called programmable logic device or ____. 230
SBR: subroutine register is abbreviated ____. 230
program counter: PC is the abbreviation for ____ ____, one of the processor registers. 231
address register: AR is the abbreviation for ____ ____, one of the processor registers. 231
data register: DR is the abbreviation for ____ ____, one of the processor registers. 231
accumulator register: AC is the abbreviation for ____ ____, one of the processor registers. 231
PC: processor register, one of the processor registers, is abbreviated ____. 231
AR: address register, one of the processor registers, is abbreviated ____. 231
DR: data register, one of the processor registers, is abbreviated ____. 231
AC: accumulator register, one of the processor registers, is abbreviated ____. 231
EA: effective address is abbreviated ____. 232
microoperation fields: F1, F2, and F3 in the microinstruction code format are the ____ ____s. 233
condition for branching: CD in the microinstruction code format is the ____ ____ ____. 233
branch field: BR in the microinstruction code format is the ____ ____. 233
address field: AD in the microinstruction code format is the ____ ____. 233
CD: condition for branching in the microinstruction code format is abbreviated ____. 233
BR: branch field in the microinstruction code format is abbreviated ____. 233
AD: address field in the microinstruction code format is abbreviated ____. 233
microoperations: the three fields F1, F2, and F3 specify ____ for the computer. 232
CD: the ____ field selects status bit conditions. 233
BR: the ____ field specifies the type of branch to be used. 233
AD: the ____ field contains a branch address. 233
microinstruction: each line of the assembly language microprogram defines a symbolic ____. 235
five: each symbolic microinstruction is divided in to ____ fields; label, microoperations, CD, BR, and AD. 235
label: the ____ field may be empty or it may specify a symbolic address. A label is terminated with a colon (;). 235
microoperations: the ____ field consists of one, two, or three symbols, separated by commas, from those defined in table 7-1. There may be no more than one symbol from each F field. The NOP symbol is used when the microinstruction has no microoperations. This will be translated by the assembler to nine zeros. 235
CD: the ____ field has one of the letters U, I, S, or Z. 236
BR: the ____ field contains one of the four symbols defined in Table 7-1. 236
AD: the ____ field specifies a value for the address field of the microinstruction in one of three possible ways; a. a symbolic address, which must also appear as a label. b. the symbol NEXT, to designate the next address in sequence. c. when the BR field contains a RET or MAP symbol, the AD field is left empty and is converted to seven zeros by the assembler. 236
