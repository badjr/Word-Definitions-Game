scheduler: the selection of certain processes to be executed from queues in a certain fashion is carried out by a ____. 112
job scheduler: also known as a long-term scheduler, selects processes from a pool stored on a mass-storage device (typically a disk), and loads them into memory for execution. 112
CPU scheduler: also known as the short-term scheduler, selects from among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them. 113
degree of multiprogramming: the long-term scheduler controls this, which is the number of processes in memory. 113
I/O-bound process: a process that spends more of its time doing I/O than it spends doing computations. 113
CPU-bound process: a process that spends more of its time doing computations than it spends doing I/O. 113
medium-term scheduler: a scheduler that removes a process from memory (and from active contention for the CPU) and this reduce the degree of multiprogramming, and later, the process can be reintroduced into memory, and its execution can be continued where it left off. 113
swapping: when a process is removed from memory and later reintroduced into memory and its execution is continued where it is left off. 113
context: the ____ includes the value of the CPU registers, the process state, and memory-management information. 114
context switch: switching the CPU to another process by performing a state save of the current process and a state restore of a different process. 114
ps -el: we use this command on UNIX and Linux systems to obtain a listing of processes. 116
cascading termination: when a process terminates and all of its children are also terminated. 121
zombie: a process that has terminated, but whose parent has not yet called wait(). 121
orphan: if a parent does not invoke wait() and instead terminated, its child processes become ____. 121
independent: ____ processes cannot affect or be affected by other processes executing in the system, and they do not share data. 122
cooperating: ____ processes can affect or be affected by other processes executing in the system, and they share data. 122
modularity: one of the reasons for providing an environment that allows process cooperation is ____, which is the degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined. 122
interprocess communication: mechanism that allows processes to exchange data/information. 122
shared memory: one of the fundamental models of interprocess communication in which a region of memory that is shared by cooperating processes is established. 122
message passing: one of the fundamental models of interprocess communication in which communication takes place by means of messages exchanged between cooperating processes. 122
synchronization: coordination. 125
message passing: provides a mechanism to allow processes to communicate and to synchronize their actions without sharing the same address space. 126
direct communication: in ____ ____, each process that wants to communicate must explicity name the recipient or sender of the communication with send(P, message) and receive(Q, message). 127
symmetry: in the ____ addressing scheme, both the sender process and the receiver process must name the other to communicate. 127
asymmetry: in the ____ addressing scheme, only the sender names the recipient; the recipient is not required to name the sender. send(P, message) and receive(id, message). 127
indirect communication: in ____ ____, process' messages are sent to and received from mailboxes, or ports. send(A, message) and receive(A, message) where A is the mailbox. two processes can communicate only if they have a shared mailbox. 128
blocking nonblocking: message passing may be either ____ or ____, also known as synchronous and asynchronous. 129
blocking send: in ____ ____, the sending process is blocked until the message is received by the receiving process or by the mailbox. 129
nonblocking send: in ____ ____, the sending process sends the message and resumes operation. 129
blocking receive: in ____ ____, the receiver blocks until a message is available. 129
nonblocking receive: in ____ ____, the receiver retrieves either a valid message or a null. 129
rendezvous: when both send() and receive() are blocking, we have a ____ between the sender and receiver. this word means a meeting at an agreed time and place, typically between two people. 129
T: T/F, the solution to the producer-consumer problem becomes trivial when we use blocking send() and receive(). 129
T: T/F, there are 3 other strategies for communication in client-server systems besides shared memory and message passing; sockets, remote procedure calls (RPCs), and pipes. 136
socket: an endpoint for communication, and an endpoint is a combinatino of an IP address and a port number. 136
loopback: the ip address 127.0.0.1 is known as the ____. 138
low level: communication using sockets--althought common and efficient--is considered a ____ ____ form of communication between distributed processes because it allows only an unstructured stream of bytes to be exchanged. 138
port: in RPC (remote procedure calls), a ____ is simply a number included at the start of a message packet. 139
big-endian: these systems store the most significant byte first. 140
little-endian: these systems store the least significant byte first. 140
pipe: a conduit allowing two processes to communicate, where a conduit is a channel for conveying water or other fluid. 142
ordinary pipe: ____ ____ allow two processes to communicate in standard producer-consumer fashion; the producer write to one end of the pipe (the write-end) and the consumer reads from the other end (the read-end). Thus, they are unidirectional, allowing only one-way communication. 142
T: T/F, typically, a parent process creates a pipe and uses it to communicate with a child process that it creates via fork(). 143
