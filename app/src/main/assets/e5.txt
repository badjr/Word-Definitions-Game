round robin: the simplest imaginable architecture. there are no interrupts. the main loop simply checks each of the I/O devices in turn and services any that need service. marvelously simple architecture---no interrupts, no shared data, no latency concerns---and therefore always an attractive potential architecture, as long as you can get away with it. 115
round robin: this architecture is probably suitable only for very simple devices such as digital watches and microwave ovens and possibly not even for those. 119
round robin with interrupts: in this architecture, interrupt routines deal with the very urgent needs of the hardware and then set flags; the main loop polls the flags and does any follow-up processing required by the interrupts. 119
function queue sheduling algorithm: in this architecture, the interrupt routines add function pointers to a queue of function pointers for the main function to call. The main routine just reads pointers from the queue and calls the functions. 127
real time operating system: in this architecture, the interrupt routines take care of the most urgent operations. they then signal that there is work for the task code to do. 129
